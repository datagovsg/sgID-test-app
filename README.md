# sgID Test Application

This is an example node application that implements sgID's OAuth2 API.

Running the app:

1. Generate a client with the redirect_url=http://localhost:10000/callback, and add the client into the corresponding server db(be it dev, stage or production). Instructions for both actions can be found in the README doc in the sgid-server repo (https://github.com/datagovsg/sgid-server). **Note: If you are running in dev, it is assumed that you have properly set up sgid-server on your local machine beforehand. If that is not the case, follow sgid-server's README to complete setup before doing so for sgid-test-app.**
1. Refer to .env.example to create .env file
1. The following variables should be set with the generated client's values in .env:
    * private key
    * client id
    * client secret
    * scopes 
1. Start nodemon by running `npm run dev`
1. Navigate to http://localhost:10000 on your browser. It should look like:
   <div>
    <img src="assets/readme/sgid-test-app-homepage.png" width="640rp" height="340rp" alt="sgid Test App Homepage">
   </div>
1. The "Login with Singpass App" interacts with the production sgid-server, whereas the "Staging" and "Development" links interact with the staging server and the local server respectively.
1. To test the sgid-test-app further, utilize sgid-mock-extension (https://github.com/datagovsg/sgid-mock-extension).
